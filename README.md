# Help me to be 'Lazy' [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dreygur/iAmLazy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dreygur/iAmLazy)

> I am too much lazy and also love to experiment with code
or my system. So, the system usually goes wrong and I need to
reinstall it. But after the installing process finishes, my job starts.
I always have to customize and install the packages mannually.
And it takes time from the reserved time for my sleep.  
_So, I somehow managed to write the scripts and helped me to be lazy_

### Requirements:

* Python 3.5 or above (_'python3 --version'_)
* pip 3 (_'sudo apt install python3-pip && pip3 --version'_)
* LSB Release Info (_'pip3 install lsb_release'_)
* Patient
* Brain

### I will make a list and update it as I write a new one or modify.

* Favourite Package Installer (_It will install the packages I like most for my linux distro_)

### How-To:
* [Favourite Packages Installer.py](https://github.com/dreygur/iAmLazy/blob/master/Python/Favourite%20Packages%20Installer.py) installs my favourite packages on debian based distro
* [Install Themes.py](https://github.com/dreygur/iAmLazy/blob/master/Python/Install%20Themes.py) configures my XFCE4-de as I like to use
* [Config vscode for me.py](https://github.com/dreygur/iAmLazy/blob/master/Python/Config%20vscode%20for%20me.py) installs the plugins I use on my Visual Studio Code
* [git.sh](https://github.com/dreygur/iAmLazy/blob/master/Bash/git.sh) updates my git repo (The script needs to be located in the responsible repo. Current Location: `Bash/git.sh`)
* [codebloks-installer.sh](https://github.com/dreygur/iAmLazy/blob/master/Bash/codebloks-installer.sh) installs Code::Blocks IDE (As I was learning C on windows so it was needed :smile:. Location: `Bash/codebloks-installer.sh`)
* [xampp_installer.sh](https://github.com/dreygur/iAmLazy/blob/master/Bash/xampp_installer.sh) install the famous XAMPP-Server on debian :smile: (Location: `Bash/xampp_installer.sh`)
* [backup.sh](https://github.com/dreygur/iAmLazy/blob/master/Bash/backup.sh) for backing up my installed packages on system (Location: `backup.sh`)
* [oracle-java.sh](https://github.com/dreygur/iAmLazy/blob/master/Bash/oracle-java.sh) Oracle JAVA SE 8 installer for linux
* `./SMS` it has a long story. To compile: `gcc -c SMS.c -o SMS -l curl`
* [Install Common Packages.cmd](https://github.com/dreygur/iAmLazy/blob/master/Windows/Install%20Common%20Packages.cmd) Installs some common Packages for my windows machine
* [Windows10Debloater.ps1](https://github.com/dreygur/iAmLazy/blob/master/Windows/Windows10Debloater.ps1) Script to remove Windows 10 bloatware

### To-Do:

* Try to port the python scripts in Bash
* Create a script to automate the scanning in __Virustotal__

### Done:

- [x] Favourite Package Installer
- [x] Theme Customizer

### Language Used:
* Python3
* Bash
* JavaScript
* GoogleScript (JS Ported for Google Suite)
* Batch (Microsoft tries to port everything they find)
* C (A little)
* C++ (Will be added)
* PHP7 (Will be added)

That's all... :relaxed:
